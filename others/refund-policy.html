    <li>Product is degrading your website performance</li>
    <li>You didn't get customer support within 2 business day (for your first implementation only)</li>

<h3> We don't think that asking for refund in the following cases is justified but we can make exception for valid
    explanation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>After 30 days of purchase</li>
    <li>You didn't test the server testing module/plugin or any free version available before making the purchase</li>
    <li>You didn't read/understand the description/purpose of the product fully (clarify by contacting us if you have
        any confusion)
    </li>
    <li>It didn't work on 'some' of your websites (Although you can use it for multiple websites, we'll only guarantee
        and give free support for the first site)
    </li>
    <li>You didn't like the design (We provide all alternative layout/designs demo. So check that before)</li>
</ul>
